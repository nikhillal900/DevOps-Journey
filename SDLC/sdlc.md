## 📝 Notes

### 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The **SDLC** is a structured process that defines the stages involved in developing software, ensuring quality and efficiency.  

There are **six main phases** I learned today:

1. **Planning**  
   - Identify the scope, objectives, resources, and risks of the project.  

2. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**  
   - Collect requirements from stakeholders.  
   - Analyze feasibility and prepare documentation such as **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)**.  

3. **Designing**  
   - Create both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**.  
   - Design documents like **DDS (Design Document Specification)** are prepared.  

4. **Building / Development**  
   - Actual coding of the application.  
   - Developers implement the design into working software.  

5. **Testing**  
   - Validate the code against requirements.  
   - Detect and fix bugs before deployment.  

6. **Deployment & Maintenance**  
   - Deploy the tested application to production.  
   - Perform ongoing monitoring and support.

### 2. How DevOps Fits into SDLC
- Traditionally, the build → test → deploy phases were **manual, slow, and error-prone**.  
- **DevOps accelerates these stages** by introducing automation and continuous practices:  
  - **CI/CD Pipelines** → automate build, test, and deployment.  
  - **Continuous Testing** → faster and more reliable quality checks.  
  - **Continuous Monitoring** → ensures stability in production.  

✅ **In short:** DevOps makes SDLC **faster, more efficient, and reliable**.

## 📖 Summary
Today I understood the **six phases of the SDLC** (Planning → Requirements → Designing → Building → Testing → Deployment) and how DevOps fits into these phases by **automating and speeding up build, testing, and deployment** processes.
